## An N-Body simulation program using all-pair algorithm
## Todos:
### 10, Rewrite the datasaving codes. 
### 20, Rewrite the rendering code. (Maybe in C instead of Python.) 
### 21, Change the rendering method. (Maybe something more mathematical, but not that mathematical.) 
### 30, Support computing on multiple devices. (Since I haven't multiple GPUs in one PC, this might take some times.(sad)) 
### 40, Support distributed computing. (Emmm.)
