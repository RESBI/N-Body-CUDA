## An N-Body simulation program using all-pair algorithm
## Todos:
### 1, Rewrite the datasaving codes. 
### 2, Rewrite the rendering code. (Maybe in C instead of Python)
### 3, Support computing on multiple devices. (Since I haven't multiple GPUs in one PC, this might take some times.(sad))
### 4, Support distributed computing. (Emmm.)
